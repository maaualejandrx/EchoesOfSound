                        The Beatles, consisting of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr,
                        were formed in Liverpool in 1960. They emerged from the British music scene to become global
                        superstars. By 1964, they had conquered the American music charts and sparked the "British
                        Invasion" of the U.S. pop market. Their career spanned a decade, marked by an evolution from
                        simple pop love songs to complex, groundbreaking musical compositions. The band's influence
                        extended beyond music into fashion, culture, and social movements, leaving an indelible mark
                        on the 20th century.

                        look. Paul McCartney had a clean-cut look with expressive eyes and a charming smile that
                        made him a fan favorite. George Harrison was recognized for his quiet demeanor, sharp
                        jawline, and stylish attire, often seen in tailored suits or Indian-inspired clothing. Ringo
                        Starr was known for his prominent nose, lively expressions, and his unique drumming style.
                        Their coordinated outfits, such as the famous matching suits and mop-top haircuts, became
                        iconic symbols of the 1960s. Each member’s individual style contributed to the band's
                        collective image as both musical innovators and trendsetters.

                        Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo are rarely seen without their iconic robot
                        helmets and gloves. These helmets, sleek and futuristic, are integral to their identity,
                        making them instantly recognizable. Bangalter's helmet features a streamlined, silver design
                        with an LED display, while Homem-Christo's is gold with a more rounded shape. The duo's
                        commitment to this robotic image extended to their public appearances and performances,
                        creating an aura of mystery. Their outfits, often consisting of black leather jackets and

                        born in Bonn, Germany, in 1770. His musical talent was evident from an early age, and he
                        soon became a prominent figure in the classical music world. His body of work spans a wide
                        range of genres, including symphonies, concertos, chamber music, and operas, each showcasing
                        his genius and innovative spirit.

                        hearing that began in his late twenties. Despite this difficulty, he continued to compose
                        and create masterpieces such as his Fifth and Ninth Symphonies. His ability to overcome
                        adversity and continue producing high-quality music makes him a symbol of perseverance and

                        These qualities are reflected in his music, which often conveys profound emotion and
                        powerful narrative force. His influence extends far beyond his time, and his legacy

                        repertoire. His innovative approach to musical form and structure laid the groundwork for
                        the development of classical music in the nineteenth century and beyond.

                        <h3>Selena's Microphone</h3>
                        <p class="full-description">
                            The microphone is a standard handheld model, silver in color with a sleek, metallic finish.
                            It features a grille at the top to capture her powerful voice. The most distinctive feature
                            is the noticeable lipstick stain near the grille, a testament to her dynamic stage presence.
                            This stain, in a vivid red hue, has become an iconic symbol of her last performance. The
                            microphone's design is both functional and aesthetically appealing, reflecting the era's
                            technology while carrying the weight of Selena's legacy. The metallic body has a polished
                            shine, indicating it was well-maintained, and the lipstick stain stands out starkly against
                            this backdrop, capturing a moment frozen in time.

                            freely on stage, engaging with her audience. This particular microphone, though similar to
                            others she used, is unique due to the lipstick mark. It was used extensively during her
                            final concert, capturing the powerful and emotional delivery of her music. Its size and
                            shape were ideal for live performances, ensuring clear sound projection. Selena's dynamic
                            use of the microphone, from belting out high-energy songs to tender ballads, highlights its
                            versatility and essential role in her performances.
